### Find missing data from *.csv and prep running conditions.
### Sometimes, running for particular conditions of (rho,psi_0,f_0) can be
## missing due to several reasons. Nevertheless, a complete data set is 
## required for accurate calculation of FLD thus requiring to re-run
## only a small portion of simulations.
## this module should provide such a feature to save computational resource.
## Currently, it is not available and thus requiring me to run the complete set of
## simulations, which can be improved.
