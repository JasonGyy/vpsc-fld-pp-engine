# VPSC-FLD-PP-ENGINE
Essential python scripts incorporated in VPSC-FLD to enable multi-threaded and
highly efficient computations to *predict* forming limit diagram (FLD) on the basis of
ViscoPlastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) crystal plasticity code developed by R. Lebensohn and C. Tome.

Note that VPSC-FLD is a separate repository but maintained in a private sector of USNISTGOV account in GitHub.
The essential portion of VPSC-FLD is publicly stored in this repository
for those who want to have a quick look at how Marciniak-Kuczynski model was incorporated into VPSC and how the multi-threaded
computation for VPSC-FLD was realized using Python's multiprocessing package.
