# VPSC-FLD-PP-ENGINE
Essential python scripts incorporated in VPSC-FLD to enable multi-threaded
highly efficient computations to *predict* forming limit diagram (FLD) on the basis of
ViscoPlastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) crystal plasticity code developed by R. Lebensohn and C. Tome.

Note that VPSC-FLD is a separate repository but maintained in a private sector of USNISTGOV account in GitHub.
The essential portion of of VPSC-FLD (that is not associated with the original VPSC code) is stored in this repository 
for those who want to have a look at how Marciniak-Kuczynski was incorporated to VPSC and how the multi-threaded
computation for VPSC-FLD was realized on the basis of Python's multiprocessing package.
Also, please find the manual written in Latex for more details (man/manual.tex).
