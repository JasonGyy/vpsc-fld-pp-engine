# VPSC-FLD-PP-ENGINE
Essential python scripts incorporated in VPSC-FLD-YLD to enable multi-threaded and
highly efficient computations to *predict* forming limit diagram (FLD) on the basis of
ViscoPlastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) crystal plasticity code developed by R. Lebensohn and C. Tome.
VPSC-FLD-YLD can be also used to characterize anisotropic yield functions on the basis of virtual experiments using VPSC.

Note that VPSC-FLD-YLD is a separate repository but maintained in a private sector of USNISTGOV account in GitHub.
The essential portion of VPSC-FLD-YLD (other than VPSC portion) is publicly stored in this repository
for those who want to have a quick look at how Marciniak-Kuczynski model was incorporated into VPSC and how the multi-threaded
computation for VPSC-FLD was realized using Python's multiprocessing package.


## FEATURES
1. FLD calculation using the micro-mechanical descriptions as employed in
 the original VPSC7b(7d) code (Ref. [3,7]).
 An FLD prediction example can be found in the below figures:

2. Link with anisotropic yield function (VPSC-YLD)
  One can charcterize anisotropic yield function (e.g., yld2000-2d) through virtual tests
  Various examples are included
  1. Various types of polycrystal yield surfaces using different amount of offset strains

  2. Subsequent evolution of polycrystalline yield surface by sequential uniaxial tension tests along RD, TD and again RD.

  3. Polycrystalline backstress can be mapped to the macro-scopic stress space as well

  4. Modules that can *characterize* state variables for the homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH) model.

3. Characterize homogeneous anisotropic hardening parameters.
The homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH) parameters can be obtained
through virtual experiments using the crystallographic RGVB model that account
for dislocation-density based hardening (Ref. [1,2,4])
  1. Through virtual experiments using VPSC-RGVB, one directly compare with distortional yield surface evolution by HAH approach

The result can be summarized by the below figures, which is auto-generated by VPSC-FLD
