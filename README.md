# vpsc-fld-pp-engine
parallel engine for VPSC-FLD

 # VPSC-FLD v1.0 does not allow communicatition between individual processes.
   VPSC-FLD v2.0 should allow communications between them in order to speed-up.

VPSC-FLD v2.0 was released but stored in a private sector due to license issue.
A portion of VPSC-FLD v.2 is stored to this repository for those who want to
have a look at how Marciniak-Kuczynski was incorporated to VPSC and how multi-threaded
run for VPSC-FLD was realized on the basis of Python's multiprocessing package.

This repository is not complete since VPSC-FLD requires VPSC source code.
For those who would like to have an access or to have a copy of the full VPSC-FLD code,
please contact me via youngung.jeong@gmail
